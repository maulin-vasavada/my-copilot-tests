# my-copilot-tests

This project is designed to demonstrate the setup of a Git repository with a focus on managing untracked files using a `.gitignore` file.

## Overview

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure that the `.gitignore` file is properly configured to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
